Super Market Billing System with File Handling and OOPs using C++.

1. Things that are new for me: 

    1. Why Some Headers Use .h and Some Donâ€™t?
    
    2. Purpose of using:
        i. iostream
        ii. fstream
        iii. sstream
        iv. windows.h

    3. New way of writing constructor like " Bill(): item(""), rate(0), quantity(0){} "

    4. Defined "Bill" class and added the data member snd member functions to it.

    5. Defined setter and getter funtions inorder to initialize the private data members.
